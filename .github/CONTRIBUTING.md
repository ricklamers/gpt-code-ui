## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before participating in the gpt-code-ui community.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Set up the development environment as follows:

To install the package as an editable Python package run:
```sh
pip install -e .
```

To run the backend:
```sh
gptcode
```

To run the frontend in dev mode such that frontend code changes automatically update, set
the following environment variable such that the frontend knows where to
find the backend API server.

`export VITE_WEB_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8080`

Run the frontend in development mode (served by Vite):
```sh
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The HMR/auto reloading version of the frontend can now be found at http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port)

Note, the frontend served at `http://localhost:8080` is stale comes from the static bundled files that can
be generated by running `make compile_frontend`.

With this setup, code changes to the Flask backend still require restarting `gptcode` (backend).

3. Explore the codebase, run tests, and verify that everything works as expected.
